# semantic-similarity-task

### Quick overview.

This is a task on NLP that I did for my bootcamp. The task is broken down into two different subtasks.

**Task 1**: Given a group of words, check semantic similarity between them, using two different models:
***en_core_web_md*** and ***en_core_web_sm***. 
Comment on the different results and explain why the first model is more accurate.

**Task 2**: Define a function that takes in a movie description and recommends the most similar movie from a movie list, reading their descriptions.


### Installation

To run the program you just need to downlaod [PYthon3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
An IDE to run Python code should be included by default (IDLE). 
If not I recommend [Visual Studio Codium](https://vscodium.com/).
At the moment no GUI is provided.
